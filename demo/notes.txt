create a node project
----------------------
npm init -y

by default test case path is test folder
if we want to change the folder then we have to define in the package.json file
in the test section


use sinon package to spy, stub and mock


how to run individual file

1) 
"scripts": {
    "test-single" : "mocha"
},

2) 
npm run test-single ./test-case/spy.spec.js


stub vs spy

stub is to call explicitly a function if we are unsure about the return value

spy is check whether the function is called with particular arguments or not


what is the difference between mock spy and stub


to generate report use mochaawesome

mochaawesome command

"test": "mocha tests 'test-case/*.spec.js' --reporter mochawesome --require mochawesome/register"


use nyc to generate the coverage
